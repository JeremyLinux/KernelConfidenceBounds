Instructions for reproducing the experimental results and figures in

"Tighter Confidence Bounds for Sequential Kernel Regression".

The .py files are modules containing helper functions.
The .ipynb notebooks contain the code that runs and records the
experiments or plots the figures.
Figures will be saved in the figures directory by default.
Results (i.e. data plotted in the figures) will be saved in the
results directory by default.

Bandits.ipynb:
- reproduces and saves the results shown in figures 2, 5, 6 and 7

Confidence Bounds.ipynb:
- reproduces and plots the results shown in Figure 1

Plots.ipynb:
- uses saved experimental results to plot figures 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7

Time Per Step.ipynb:
- reproduces and saves the results shown in figure 4
